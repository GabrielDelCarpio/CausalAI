The article seeks to evaluate and test what type of predictive model works best to predict the prices of properties rented on Airbnb in New York given various heterogeneous characteristics such as customer reviews, characteristics of the owner and details of the home to be rented. This is special since it allows us to know factors hidden in plain sight, which allow both owners and clients to prepare for changes in prices. Additionally, the work applies sentiment analysis to customer feedback to improve the predictive power of the models.

On the one hand, the article satisfactorily answers the question posed since by first using a preselection of the characteristics with greater predictive power through Lasso CV it offers a better general performance to the proposed regression models, which is evidenced in the high $R^2$ and low MAE and MSE shown in both the training, testing and validation samples (except for the basic linear regression model in the last case). Furthermore, comparing predictive models with different methodologies helps to compare different conclusions that would not otherwise be easily found if only one model were evaluated in detail. Likewise, incorporating sentiment analysis as a feature is important in this context, where a large number of Airbnb establishment customers are guided mainly by previous experiences, which is a great contribution from researchers.

On the other hand, although the article manages to answer what was stated and shows relevant results, the analysis is not complementary with other useful methodologies that deal with overfitting and with the statistical inference of the context. For example, when selecting the predictive variables, it only compares standard methods with Lasso CV, when in reality there are other regularization methods such as Ridge and Elastic Net that can be equally or more useful. If the objective was to find the model that performs better and has greater predictive power, it would be logical that greater efforts be used at this stage. Likewise, although the authors focus mainly on evaluating the fit of the models, ignoring the context of the data harms the finding of better results. It seems that the methods used could be applied to any type of business "X" where greater predictive power is sought regarding the price of the products given different characteristics and not exactly to one of establishment services, since it does not take into account factors external determinants that also affect Airbnbs, such as inflation, natural disasters in the area and seasons of the year. For this reason, in my opinion, the title of the article is not understood, since it does not mention whether the customer feelings variable is selected by lasso CV, nor do we even know its relevance in the subsequent results, just as we do not know exactly why they focus on the Airbnb business. In reality, the article should refer only to the study of the performance of predictive methods applying lasso cross validation and with heterogeneous features.

The article has very important contributions: (i) it highlights the importance of previously applying regularization methods to deal with the overfitting problem, evidenced by better performance in all models, in addition to a very similar one; (ii) shows that predictive models, with the help of CV lasso selection, perform better than standard linear regression in training samples, highlighting the importance of applying machine learning algorithms to predict prices; (iii) evidence that prescriptive models that apply penalty parameters have better fit than those that do not and are even more complex, resulting in the SVR and K-means + Ridge model as winners over the neutral networks and Gradient Boost; (iv) the high precision capacity of the models is promising since it involves the analysis of heterogeneous characteristics that were previously impossible to consider. In that sense, the article answers and advances the research question posed.

According to the article, studying other selection schemes, further experimentation with neural network architectures and obtaining larger training samples for other hospital services would be objectives for future work on the question posed. However, according to me, it would be to complement the analysis of the study with greater statistical inference and not only evaluate methods, this to provide the results with greater structural and not just empirical validity. Furthermore, it would be necessary to evaluate a large number of predictive models after applying regularization methods, since having a very similar fit does not allow us to capture the real differences between the models, which does not clarify at first glance the reasons why a model works better than another, which is what I think every researcher should look for, the reason for their results.

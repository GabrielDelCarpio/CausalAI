Faced with a context in which the literature and studies on the causal effects of heterogeneous treatment samples have been of little significance, presenting at the same time serious procedural restrictions, the authors seek to know if, through non-parametric methods, specifically regression trees, it is It is possible that, in addition to its usefulness for classifying and predicting, statistical inference can be generated, posing various assumptions of Gaussian asymptotic theory, among others, to generate a causal inference that allows the effects of the treatment sample to be estimated in a consistent and unbiased manner. through what we will call causal trees and, later, causal forests.

A notable strength of the method developed in the paper is establishing a Gaussian asymptotic theory with unbiased results and that can even allow the estimation of the variance of the treatment effect. This has given a very large opening, under the literature analyzed in the paper, to evaluate the performance of the models for estimating treatment effects, a fact that had not been able to be fully addressed in the literature without being unbiased and consistent. Furthermore, such theory is not only applied to the trees but also holds when the causal forest is found and when the model wants to be evaluated under the prediction error and the convergence to the real result.

Another notable strength of the paper is that, when generating the sheets (subsamples of the training samples), combined with the randomness of their selection together with the assumptions of unfoundedness, honesty, overlap and the algorithms that follow to meet such assumptions and achieving consistency and unbiasedness maintain the essence of machine learning methods but expanding on a large scale, which combined with local methods on the specific testing point show ramifications guided by the data, which in practice is very desirable. Furthermore, such assumptions for generating leaves mean that the expanded asymptotic theory in trees is maintained for the causal forest, since the irrelevant variance loses its effect with larger training sample sizes, keeping the results unbiased.

Especially since random forests are a non-paramedical method based on the behavior of its nearest neighbor, but not based on its minimum distance as in the case of K nearest neighbors but rather based on the predicted values ​​of a subsample that are close to other close values, the paper demonstrates that its use for high dimensionality and, in general, for more challenging circumstances, it is possible to establish inference, at least in a specific confidence interval, which is an enormous advance for causal inference under this context.

The main weaknesses of the paper come from the fact that: first, by performing the estimation in a specific test and not globally, different causal forests have to be estimated to find greater validity in the rest of the features, which can be counterproductive if desired. evaluate more heterogeneous contexts and effects and increase the computational load; second, the predicted results fall short of being completely unbiased and do not perform as well under low dimensionality as the standard methods in all scenarios; Third, the assumption of the size of the subsamples derived from the training samples, that is, the number of splits, follows a rule that cannot be met in every context, which makes its choice arbitrary and could dismiss the results given that From this, the branches and the entire model in general are generated.

The authors manage to answer the research question of the paper by finding and establishing a method to estimate the treatment effects and perform causal inference with it through assumptions of Gaussian asymptotic theory, evaluating the performance of the model and making the results unbiased and consistent for a problem that had previously not been able to be resolved, in that sense, producing a notable advance in the literature for causal inference with machine learning.

It is important to recognize that the assumptions of normality, randomization of the samples, their independence, symmetry, tree regularity, regular alpha partition, among others, cannot be met under all contexts. The derived estimates that are adapted from local methods are, in my opinion, very data-driven, which is not desirable in all contexts in which causal inference is sought. If the purpose is to make such an inference, it is necessary to understand the theoretical framework behind the data, and not use its information per se, which, although statistically and empirically it may seem like a good guide to predict, it does not mean that it can be equally good to find cause-effect relationships. Causal trees seem to be much more useful for performing causal inference under contexts in which the theoretical drivers of the data are largely unknown, without being clear about how one variable influences another, as is the case shown in the paper. When such information is unknown, it is best to let the data speak for itself.
